                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    In general the objectives of any PHEOC include: Coordination of the response to 
                    public health events  emergencies with all relevant stakeholders, Mobilization 
                    and deployment of resources, including surge capacity, services and supplies to 
                    support all PHEOC functions, Timely, event-specific operational decision-making 
                    using available information, policy, technical advice and plan, Collection, 
                    collation, analysis, presentation and utilization of health event data and 
                    information to guide the response and Designing appropriate health messages 
                    for creation of public awareness, community engagement and social mobilization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Sidama regional Public Health Emergency Coordination Center (PHECC) is based
                    at regional public health institute (SPHI). The organized regional PHEOC and IMS 
                    structure was established early before covid-19 pandemic due to previous 
                    experience of emergency activities including coordination of polio supplementary
                    immunization activities and AWD emergencies and strengthend throught the
                    pandemic meetting its objectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                Following the establishment of regional public heath institute(SPHI) the EOC  
                furthermore reorganized allining with the newly organizational structure as 
                wel as in cocideration with demands to fit the change circumstances of emergency 
                situation. The PHEOC organization  is modular, adaptable and scalable to allow
                    elements to be escalet or descalet as the needs of the emergency or disaster 
                    change over time. The structure Was organised using IMS model and it incoropert
                    major IMS functions. Sections includs Coordination and Collaboration, Planning 
                    and resource mobilization, Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE), 
                    Case management and facility readiness, Logistics and supply chain management, 
                    Human workforce and Early warning and Surveillance (Epidemiological and 
                    laboratory Surveillance). Following are discussed major elements of PHEOC as 
                    concerning the regional EOC.
                </p> 
                <h2>Policies, Planning and procedures</h2>
                <p>
                    The core objective of the plans and procedures should describe standards, 
                    regulations, planning frameworks, guidelines, plans and procedures related to 
                    public health emergency operations centres (PHEOCs). 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    At a minimum, EOCs should include roles responsible for command; operations; 
                    planning; logistics; finance/administration; intelligence; investigations; 
                    information management; communication (internal, inter-agency and risk 
                    communication); reporting/briefing; staff safety; and security. 
                    Depending on the type of emergency, public health functions – such as 
                    surveillance, data collection and analysis, epidemiology, laboratory, and 
                    disease control – ¬should also be included. More research is required into the 
                    best way to incorporate these public health functions into a traditional incident 
                    management system
                </p> 
                <p>
                    planning frameworks for health emergencies should incorporate the following
                    approaches and characteristics: risk management; all-hazards planning 
                    (plus hazard-specific planning where necessary. comprehensive approach 
                    incorporating risk prevention/mitigation, preparedness, detection 
                    (when communicable diseases are involved), response and recovery.
                    The cycle of emergency planning and preparedness should include assessment of 
                    an agency’s capacity (resources) and capabilities (such as training and 
                    credentialing) to respond; building and maintaining the necessary capacities 
                    and capabilities; testing them in exercises and real events; and reporting on 
                    the response in after action reviews, ensuring that lessons learned are 
                    incorporated into emergency plans effectiveness of a public health emergency 
                    operations centre.                     
                </p>
                <h2>Physical infrastructure</h2>
                <p>
                    The PHEOC facility can be housed in a dedicated, purpose-built space, 
                    or set up in a multipurpose space. It must be physically and environmentally 
                    secure. It should be able to survive the most probable hazards identified 
                    through a tailored risk assessment. In the case of potential technological and 
                    other failures, alternatives should be available, and a backup physical location
                     should be ready in case the primary PHEOC becomes unusable. The PHEOC must be 
                     easily accessible with adequate parking for both staff and private vehicles
                </p> 
                <p>
                    In this regard the regional PHEOC  realized  most of the requrments having the 
                    following facilities: Adequate space for staff – this includes both open common 
                    areas and closed workspaces suitable for meetings, conference calls and small
                     group activities. The configuration of the space should cater for both meeting
                      areas and relatively quiet working spaces. External venues necessary for media 
                      briefings, interviews, press conferences, and coordination of external partners.
                       Sufficient size to accommodate all its functions with reasonable comfort.
                        Concerning issues in this regared is that the absence alternatives location 
                        that should be available, as a backup and ready in case the primary PHEOC
                         becomes unusable. And there is also some sort of restraints concerning
                          furnitures both in quantity and quality
                </p>
                <h2>Information and communication technology infrastructure </h2>
                <p>
                    Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure enable data 
                    management and both internal and external communications. It consists of 
                    hardware, software and communication equipment. ICT Hardware The hardware 
                    components consist of equipment that facilitate communication, data capture 
                    and analysis, and presentation and dissemination of information for 
                    decision-making. The regional EOC have some of Suggested hardware for the 
                    PHEOC are: Smart television sets Telephones, Computers, Video and 
                    teleconferencing facilities Internet switch and Wi-Fi access points  
                    and Server. Existing substantial gabs in this areas are under optimal 
                    installation and utilization of the available ICT equipment mainly due to 
                    training and skill gaps and unavailability of some other equipment. 
                    Furthermore there is absence and limitation of appropriate software components 
                    for the operationalization of the ICT Such as software like Data analysis and 
                    visualization software. There is also absents and shortage of some office 
                    equipments and supplies at EOC such as copiers, scanners, fax and stationeries
                </p>
                <h2>Information systems and standards</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of an effective PHEOC information system is to increase the availability,
                    accessibility, quality, timeliness, and usefulness of emergency operations 
                    information for public health action. Such an information system should support 
                    all the functions of the PHEOC, and have the capacity to: Ensure data security, 
                    privacy, and confidentiality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coordination of information on PHEs is crucial. The PHEOC should serve as a 
                    hub for reporting PHEs, and coordination of information. All information on 
                    PHEs must systematically flow to the PHEOC. Despite their inherent utility, 
                    the technologies that support telecommunications, data analysis, event 
                    information management and visualization of operational information are 
                    evolving rapidly and can be prone to failures. Consequently, the information 
                    that the systems contain requires frequent, routine backup to mitigate the 
                    potential impact of a technological and other failure resulting in loss of data. 
                    In the event of communication breakdown, a backup communication system should be 
                    installed to enable continuity of operations. In this regard the regional EOC 
                    has extensive gaps as such the EOC data are not beibg well organized, managed, 
                    used for decision making, communicated and securely stored
                </p>
                <h2>Human resources and surge capacities</h2>
                <p>
                    A PHEOC requires competent and trained persons to achieve its objectives and 
                    function successfully. Ideally, PHEOC staff should be familiar with the structure 
                    and systems for a public health response. Human resource needs for maintaining 
                    and operating a PHEOC include both routine/ permanent and surge staff. During 
                    full activation, the PHEOC will co-opt surge staff from other departments, 
                    agencies, organizations, partners and volunteers among others based on their 
                    competencies and skills. They must: Be trained in the functions and operations 
                    of a PHEOC and Have relevant subject matter expertise. The regional EOC have 
                    relatively adequate permanent EOC staff. The existing gaps is that there is no 
                    mechanisms for the development and mobilization of surge staff. PHEOC should 
                    maintain a database of multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral experts who can be 
                    mobilized and deployed to the PHEOC during occurrence of an incident/ emergency. 
                    The other gap is absence or limited training to EOC staff.  The capacity and 
                    skills of PHEOC staff are a key factor for effective management of public health 
                    emergencies PHEOC should organize regular training of SME and conduct simulation 
                    exercises to test the PHEOC plans, procedures, and systems regularly
