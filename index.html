                        displacements, and other public health issues requires the 
                        integration and effective application of skills of multi-sectoral
                        and multidisciplinary experts and logistics collaboration    
                </P>
                <p>
                    Ethiopia continues to experience recurrent outbreaks of Cholera, malnutrition, 
                    measles, COVID-19 and other public health and humanitarian emergencies. 
                    The Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) and Ministry of Health 
                    (MOH), in collaboration with their stakeholders and partners, have been 
                    responding to public health emergencies occurred in various areas at different
                        times.

                <p>
                    Ethiopia has established PHEOCs to serve as a central hub for better coordinating 
                    the preparation, response, and recovery for public health emergencies. 
                    PHEOC must have a guideline or handbook that guides its operations and management 
                    at all times. This handbook will be utilized across the nation as a reference to
                        guide PHEOC management and operations. Sub-national levels can adapt it to their
                        own specific local context to enhance sub-national emergency response operations
                        in a coordinated manner.

                    <p>One of the findings of the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) conducted in March 2016 was lack of a
                        well-established emergency coordination unit, a Public Health Emergency Operations Center
                        (PHEOC) and factors that makes it function effectively including an existence of a handbook.
                        Since then, tremendous efforts have been made to establish PHEOC in order to ensure the optimal
                        PHEM is emplaced. To this end, it is imperative to prepare a PHEOC handbook which can guide
                        the PHEOC activities throughout the country

                        The public health system of Ethiopia is continually challenged (directly and indirectly) by recurrent and
                        unexpected disease outbreaks from Public Health Events (PHEs) originated within the country and
                        imported from outside. PHEs occurred at different parts of the world can exert significant challenge at
                        the National health system and results significant lose and morbidity in the community. The rapidly
                        expanding global economy, the convergence of people in large urban areas, the ease with which people
                        and goods travel around the world, emergence of new infectious agents, the wide distribution of
                        manufactured foods, and the changing nature of our environment are some of the factors challenging
                        the public health system to quickly recognize and respond to widely dispersed PHEs.
                        Among the major outbreaks happened globally which impacts the country health system structure, the
                        2018 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa which resulted in over 11,000 deaths, the
                        ongoing emergencies of the Middle east Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus (MERS-COV) since 2012,
                        the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic which affected several parts of the world resulting in over 14,000
                        deaths, the 2004 avian influenza and the currently ongoing COVID-19 emergency were the major ones

                        The activities in the PHEM guideline are to be implemented nationwide with the involvement of all
                        relevant stakeholders. As the name implies, PHEM deals with the management of all public health
                        emergency issues, including disease outbreaks, nutritional emergencies and health consequences of
                        natural and human made disasters. Topics that will be covered in this guideline include PHEM
                        coordination, early warning, surveillance, preparedness, response, recovery, and resilience as well as
                        cross-border communicable disease control and regulations. Hence this guideline addresses all public
                        health emergencies related issues and shall be implemented at all levels throughout the country. The
                        information and activities in this guideline are intended for use by health managers and health staff at all
                        levels of the health system (federal, regional, zonal, woreda and health facilities) and to other sectors
