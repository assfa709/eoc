                    <b><i>Public health emergency response</i></b>  to disease outbreaks, disasters,
                        displacements, and other public health issues requires the

                    Sidama region continues to experience recurrent outbreaks of Cholera, measles, 
                    malaria, malnutrition, COVID-19 and other public health and humanitarian emergencies. 
                    The Sidama region Public Health Institute (SPHI) in collaboration with their stakeholders 
                    and partners, have been responding to public health emergencies occurred in various areas 
                    at different times.

                    The region has established PHEOCs to serve as a central hub for better coordinating 
                    the preparation, response, and recovery for public health emergencies.

                    Sidama region has established PHEOCs to serve as a central hub for better

                </p>
                <h2>Function of PHEOC</h2>
                <p>
                    To strengthen the regional capacity for coordinating the preparedness, response and recovery
                    from the public health emergencies (PHEs) and to enhance real-time communication at all level,
                    it is crucial to have a functional PHEOC.A PHEOC plays critical role in fulfilling the areas of
                    emergency support functions of the nation, IHR-2005 obligations as well as the Integrated
                    Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) core functions.

                <h2>Physical Location</h2>
                <p>
                    The regional PHEOC is located at SPHI on the 3rd floor of Data mnagement Center (DMC)
Building
                </p>
                <h2>Call center</h2>
                <p>
                    The call center is part of the national PHEOC function. Itâ€™s one of the platforms to conduct Event
                    Based Surveillance (EBS) that help to receive public health alerts or rumors, provide health
                    education and public awareness creation
                                    </p>

                <h2>Incident Management System</h2>
                <p>
                    The PHEOC uses IMS to coordinate and manage PHEs responses, primarily to prepare for,
respond to, recover from and mitigate the effects of all types of PHEs. The IMS is an emergency
management organizational structure that, alongside protocols and procedures, provides an
approach for a coordinated and timely response. The system is modular and scalable, hence can
be partially or fully activated depending on the scale of the event. The IMS embraces five
functions: management, operations, planning, logistics and administration and finance

                <h2>Risk Assesment</h2>
                <p>
                    The PHEOC conducts risk assessment to determine if the incident requires PHEOC activation
and determine the level of activation. The assessment can be done by the PHEOC staff and
subject matter experts

                <p>
                    As of 3 Feb. 2024, 1163 cases of measles have been
                    reported since the outbreak has been declared in the
                    region at the beginning of May 2023. The outbreak
                    has affected 26 woredas so far. The number of cases
                    has increased by 162 (16%) in the week. A total of 13
                    related deaths have been reported including the one
                    reported in this week. The outbreak is rapidly
                    spreading throughout the region especially in recent
                    weeks. Mop-up vaccinations have been conducted in
                    the outbreak woredas and patients with
                    complications have been treated in HFs.
