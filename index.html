                    <b><i>Public health emergency response</i></b>  to disease outbreaks, disasters,
                     displacements, and other public health issues requires the 
                     integration and effective application of skills of multi-sectoral
                      and multidisciplinary experts and logistics collaboration

                    Ethiopia continues to experience recurrent outbreaks of Cholera, malnutrition, measles, COVID-
19 and other public health and humanitarian emergencies. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute
(EPHI) and Ministry of Health (MOH), in collaboration with their stakeholders and partners, have
been responding to public health emergencies occurred in various areas at different times.

                <p>
                    Ethiopia has established PHEOCs to serve as a central hub for better coordinating the preparation,
response, and recovery for public health emergencies. PHEOC must have a guideline or handbook
that guides its operations and management at all times. This handbook will be utilized across the
nation as a reference to guide PHEOC management and operations. Sub-national levels can adapt
it to their own specific local context to enhance sub-national emergency response operations in a
coordinated manner.

                    In general the objectives of any PHEOC include: Coordination 
                    of the response to public health events  emergencies with all
                     relevant stakeholders, Mobilization and deployment of 
                     resources, including surge capacity, services and supplies
                      to support all PHEOC functions, Timely, event-specific 
                      operational decision-making using available information, 
                      policy, technical advice and plan, Collection, collation, 
                      analysis, presentation and utilization of health event data
                       and information to guide the response and Designing 
                       appropriate health messages for creation of public 
                       awareness, community engagement and social mobilization.

                    The Sidama regional Public Health Emergency Coordination Center (PHECC) is 
                    based at regional public health institute (SPHI). The organized regional 
                    PHEOC and IMS structure was established early before covid-19 pandemic due 
                    to previous experience of emergency activities including coordination of 
                    polio supplementary immunization activities and AWD emergencies and 
                    strengthend throught the pandemic meetting its objectives. 
                    Following the establishment of regional public heath institute(SPHI)
                     the EOC  furthermore reorganized allining with the newly organizational 
                     structure as wel as in cocideration with demands to fit the change 
                     circumstances of emergency situation. The PHEOC organization  is modular, 
                     adaptable and scalable to allow elements to be escalet or descalet as the 
                     needs of the emergency or disaster change over time. The structure Was 
                     organised using IMS model and it incoropert major IMS functions. 
                     Sections includs Coordination and Collaboration, Planning and resource 
                     mobilization, Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE), 
                     Case management and facility readiness, Logistics and supply chain 
                     management, Human workforce and Early warning and Surveillance 
                     (Epidemiological and laboratory Surveillance). Following
                     are discussed major elements of PHEOC as concerning the regional EOC.

                <p>One of the findings of the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) conducted in March 2016 was lack of a
                    well-established emergency coordination unit, a Public Health Emergency Operations Center
                    (PHEOC) and factors that makes it function effectively including an existence of a handbook.
                    Since then, tremendous efforts have been made to establish PHEOC in order to ensure the optimal
                    PHEM is emplaced. To this end, it is imperative to prepare a PHEOC handbook which can guide
                    the PHEOC activities throughout the country</p>

                    The public health system of Ethiopia is continually challenged (directly and indirectly) by recurrent and
unexpected disease outbreaks from Public Health Events (PHEs) originated within the country and
imported from outside. PHEs occurred at different parts of the world can exert significant challenge at
the National health system and results significant lose and morbidity in the community. The rapidly
expanding global economy, the convergence of people in large urban areas, the ease with which people
and goods travel around the world, emergence of new infectious agents, the wide distribution of
manufactured foods, and the changing nature of our environment are some of the factors challenging
the public health system to quickly recognize and respond to widely dispersed PHEs.
Among the major outbreaks happened globally which impacts the country health system structure, the
2018 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa which resulted in over 11,000 deaths, the
ongoing emergencies of the Middle east Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus (MERS-COV) since 2012,
the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic which affected several parts of the world resulting in over 14,000
deaths, the 2004 avian influenza and the currently ongoing COVID-19 emergency were the major ones

                    The activities in the PHEM guideline are to be implemented nationwide with the involvement of all
                    relevant stakeholders. As the name implies, PHEM deals with the management of all public health
                    emergency issues, including disease outbreaks, nutritional emergencies and health consequences of
                    natural and human made disasters. Topics that will be covered in this guideline include PHEM
                    coordination, early warning, surveillance, preparedness, response, recovery, and resilience as well as
                    cross-border communicable disease control and regulations. Hence this guideline addresses all public
                    health emergencies related issues and shall be implemented at all levels throughout the country. The
                    information and activities in this guideline are intended for use by health managers and health staff at all
                    levels of the health system (federal, regional, zonal, woreda and health facilities) and to other sectors
                    and development partners who directly and indirectly support the PHEM system. These include
